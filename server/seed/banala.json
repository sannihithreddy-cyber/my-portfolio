      "I'm drawn to the moment when a messy spreadsheet becomes a clear answer. After 2+ years working across consulting and enterprise analytics — at BDO Global and Wipro — I've built dashboards that replaced Monday morning emails and SQL pipelines that made the data team's backlog disappear.",
      "Whether it's migrating 12+ legacy Crystal reports to Power BI, cutting report load times by 40% with star-schema SQL views, or supporting 50+ business users on a US telecom account, the common thread is always the same: make the data work for the people who need to act on it, not the other way around.",
      "Outside client work, I'm building a market-data pipeline in Python — pulling live sector ETF data, running KMeans clustering to find behavioural patterns that standard sector labels miss, and using a Markov transition matrix to make the output actually investable. It's the kind of project that keeps the tools sharp."
