      "I'm a data analyst who genuinely loves digging into data — not just building reports but actually figuring out what's going on underneath. Finding a pattern that wasn't obvious, or realizing why a number looks weird, is the part of the job I look forward to.",
      "I've spent the past 2+ years working in Power BI, SQL, and Python across consulting and enterprise environments. Most of that time has been client-facing — translating messy, inconsistent data into dashboards people actually open on Monday morning.",
      "Outside of work I'm usually working on personal projects that sit somewhere between data science and machine learning — stuff I find interesting enough to actually finish."
